This is Erin’s Wiki Repo. This is where she keeps a copy of all of her articles listed on [her wiki](https://wiki.dudethatserin.com)

If you want to add this to your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, all you have to do is download the files/folders and place them in your vault!

If you have any requests for this, you can let me know in the “issues” section.

## Credits
This is everyone I credit for helping me make this possible.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and their community. I wouldn't have had the drive to do this without them.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It would be much harder if it wasn't for GitHub Pages.

[Working Copy iOS App](https://workingcopy.app) & Git on Windows. These make it possible for me to push to this GitHub Repo.
