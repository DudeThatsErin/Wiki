This is where I have all of the other resources I use for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I use these to help me with my playthrough whilst trying to 100% the game. As I find more good resources I will be linking them here.

#### Other Pages I have
[All Pony Points](../../botw-totk/totk/allponypoints.html)

[All Shrine, Lightroots, & Tower Locations & Rewards](../../botw-totk/totk/allshrinelighttower.html)
<h4>Interactive Maps</h4>
These are extremely useful for finding enemies, camps, etc.

<a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/hyrule">IGN's TOTK Interactive Map</a> - This one is good though it isn't obvious how to get to the depths or sky island maps. For reference, you scroll all of the way up or down and eventually you will get to the other maps. Not as user friendly as it could be.

<a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-interactive-map">Zelda Dungeon Interactive Map</a> - This is the one I use. It is super simple to filter items on the right side and you can get to the other maps by clicking buttons on the left. They even link to more information on how to get Koroks.
<h4>Other Resources</h4>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1an06KpSDgW0MLfFs346EOXXBhElYuzTvPhdxXp6T8Hs/edit#gid=750468372" target="_blank">Tears of the Kingdom Armor Google Sheet Document</a> - 

<a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Materials_and_Resources_List">IGN's Materials &amp; Resources List</a> - I highly recommend this page as it is not nearly as bad as their interactive map. I use IGN for everything else besides the map.

<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-faq-information-guide/">The Gamer FAQ Guide</a> - If you are a complete newbie to the newer Zelda games, this is a great resource for you to learn the mechanics of how to start a fire, how to dye your armor, and how to save. There is also more advanced information like how to use a device dispenser and what are Zonai charges used for.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Linkus7">Linkus7</a> - He is a great YouTuber for watching how to do different glitches in the game. As of 1.1.2 most have been patched out though I have my auto-updates disabled and I even forget my Wifi Network before I insert the game card just in case. I'm sticking with 1.1.1 as the game is too grindy without the duplication glitches and such.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AustinJohnPlays">Austin John Plays</a> - He is a fantastic YouTuber that goes over glitches as well as the best methods to go through the game.

### Hyrule Compendium Prices
This is the feature that allows you to use Sensor+ to locate items. You get this by completing the Sensor & Sensor+ quests from Robbie. You can buy them from the Hateno Tech Lab, where Robbie will be after you complete these.
To buy all pictures you need a total of **XX** Rupees. This amount goes down based on the number of pictures you take yourself.
#### Fauna Picture
87 total for 100 each
#### Enemy Picture
73 total for 100 each
#### Material Picture
116 total for 100 each
#### Weapon Picture
XX total for 100 each

### How EXP & Level Scaling works in TOTK & BOTW
This is explained beautifully by Austin so I’m plugging his video. What it boils down to is this:
You can defeat 10 of the same enemy and those experience points count towards progressing of the game. After those 10 they don’t help. So a max of 10 of each enemy type count towards getting better weapons, shields, etc.
